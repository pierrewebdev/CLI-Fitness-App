## The Fitness Tracker

Hello and welcome to my mod 1 project for the flatiron bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to create a command line application that has an intuitive user experience. The app I have built is a tool that can keep track of a user's exercises and exercise sessions.

### Motivations
I built this app in order to practice using Active Record and Sqlite. Through the use of Active Record and Sqlite, I have managed to create a command line application that allows the user to create new exercise , retrieve previously created exercise, update information pertaining to a specific exercise and 

### Technology stack used
I built this app using Ruby, the Active Record gem and the Sqlite database. I created the user interface using the tty-prompt gem.

### How to use
If you would like to use my project first you should fork or clone yourself a copy of it and enter bundle install in the project's directory to download all the dependencies you will need to run the app.

I will now provide some instructions as to how to use this app:

1. In order to start the app, enter the following command "rake start" and you will be brought to a screen to enter a username
2. Create a user name and press enter
3. Afterwards you will be brought to a menu with a few different options
